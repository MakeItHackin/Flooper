## DESCRIPTION:  
The Super Duper Flipper Flooper is an add-on for your Flipper Zero and transforms it into a Wearable Electronic Conference Badge.  It contains color-changing RGB LEDs, a display, 3D printed conference holder, and lanyard.  The Flooper features a "Flashy Mode" for walking around the conference, video game, and flashlight.  Stickers and Googly Eyes are also included :)  (Flipper Zero is not included and is only used in images for reference)

Watch the YouTube Tutorial for a full walk-through and demonstration.  

There are two versions of the Flooper:  
Version 2 (V2) is powered from the 3.3 Volt power bus from the GPIO port on your Flipper Zero.  This version is plug-and-play and no settings need to be adjusted on the Flipper Zero.  
Version 1 is powered from the 5 Volt power bus from the GPIO port on your Flipper Zero and requires that the user turn on the 5 Volt GPIO setting each time the power is cycled on the Flipper Zero or Flooper.  Since most people don't fully turn off their Flipper, this situation doesn't need to happen much.  See the YouTube video for a demonstration between the two different voltage types.  

Only the positive voltage and ground pins are electrically connected on the GPIO pins.  

The Flooper runs on it's own microcontroller, therefore no programming is necessary and you don't need to load or configure any software.  It's plug and play!

The 3D printed holder helps transform your Flooper into a wearable badge.  Make sure to have the Flooper of another FULL-GPIO add-on board installed when using as a lanyard badge.  If you do not have a FULL-GPIO add-on installed, the Flipper Zero will slip out of the holder.  The holder can also be useful to display your Flipper on a desk or shelf.

"Flashy Mode" on the Flooper is the mode in which there are a lot of colorful lights and messages on the display.  There is one message that you can customize via the "SET TEXT" feature in the menu options.

Please review the documentation via the Github link for instructions on how to use the Flooper, including the video game.
