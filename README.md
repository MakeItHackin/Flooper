# Super Duper Flipper Flooper
#### What is it?
The Super Duper Flipper Flooper is an add-on for your Flipper Zero and transforms it into a Wearable Electronic Conference Badge.  It contains color-changing RGB LEDs, a display, 3D printed conference holder, and lanyard.  The Flooper features a "Flashy Mode" for walking around the conference, video game, and flashlight.  Stickers are also included :)

Watch the YouTube Tutorial for a full walk-through and demonstration (coming soon)

The Flooper is powered from the 3.3 Volt power bus from the GPIO port on your Flipper Zero.  Only the positive voltage and ground pins are electrically connected.  

The Flooper runs on it's own microcontroller, therefore no programming is necessary and you don't need to load or configure any software.  It's plug and play!

The 3D printed holder helps transform your Flooper into a wearable badge.  Make sure to have the Flooper of another FULL-GPIO add-on board installed when using as a lanyard badge.  If you do not have a FULL-GPIO add-on installed, the Flipper Zero will slip out of the holder.  The holder can also be useful to display your Flipper on a desk or shelf.

"Flashy Mode" on the Flooper is the mode in which there are a lot of colorful lights and messages on the display.  There is one message that you can customize via the "SET TEXT" feature in the menu options.

Please review the documentation via the Github link for instructions on how to use the Flooper, including the video game.  (full instructions coming soon).
